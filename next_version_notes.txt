General:
More LEDs - but option to turn them all off. Common LED ground plane.
bypass cap for each ic
mounting holes

Control logic:
Interrupts - maybe like 8 lines that go with the bus? or 16, but 4 interrupt values per device? i.e. each attached thing owns 2 lines
timer interrupt - so binary counter incrementing, wire top output into interrupt register
interrupt mask register?

Registers:
stack pointer? - adding to stack pointer requires 16 bit arithmetic so just make the whole thing 16 bit?
more registers?

Clock:
Option for crystal oscillator module

Operations:
LU ops - AND etc

Display module:
LCD, its own SRAM, its on CLK, its on processor
