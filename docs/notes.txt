- Do everything at 1.8 V? Avoids translation of voltages + needing regulators.
  May be too hard to find chips that run at 1.8 V.
- Simulate using verilog somehow?
  make each 74 series (etc) chip in verilog. maybe can even generate schematics from it
  also put in timing information
  maybe even voltage information + high impedance information?

- simulate delays and stuff in verilog - ensure timing requirements are held?
- work out maximum clock rate in verilog - e.g. could bsearch on assertions on frequency (combine with above)

 Verilog notes:
 	wire, variable
 	uwire
 	tri, wire, tri0, tri1 (pulldown, pullup), net types
