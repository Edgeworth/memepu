#### DRAM notes:
Several different topologies, e.g. ranks - where bank addresses aren't enough
so duplicate signals (e.g. CK => CK0, CK1). Can be faster though.
Different underlying dram chip types (e.g. 16 bit, 8 bit).
S0, S1 selects rank

Power consumption: ~3 W per stick. need ~2A 

Pinout - IN means 'into dram', OUT means 'output from DRAM'
VDD: 1.8 V
VREF: 1.8 / 2 V
DQxx: [0, 64) data in/out - IN/OUT
DQSx, ~DQSx: [0, 8) data strobes - IN/OUT
 On write to DRAM chip: Need to send this, DRAM chip uses this to latch data
 On read, DRAM chip sends this to signal data (writes 1s to these at the same time as writing the actual data)
DMx: [0, 8) data mask - IN
  On write to DRAM chip, lets byte x be written if low, otherwise ignores.
  No effect on read.
Ax: [0, 13); A10 additionally autoprecharge; Optional extra A14, A15 - IN
BA0, BA1, BA2: bank address - IN
CK0,~CK0,CK1,~CK1: Clocks - IN
~CAS, ~RAS: column select, row select - IN
~WE: Write enable - IN
~S0, ~S1: Chip selects; selects rank - IN
CKE0,CKE1: Clock enables - IN

SPD:
VDDSPD: Can be 1.8V ~ 3.3V
SDA: Needs pullup to VDDSPD. - IN/OUT
SCL: SPD clock. - IN
SA0, SA1: SPD and TS address - IN

MISC:
ODT0, ODT1: On die termination - IN
~EVENT: Temperature stuff? not really relevant

Signal groups - should be wired to have same loading + routing:
CK, ~CK
DQ, DM, DQS, ~DQS
~S, CKE, ODT
A, BA, ~RAS, ~CAS, ~WE
