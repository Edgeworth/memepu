Voltage translation ICs:

TXS0108: (TXB is not open-drain) 8 bit

Notes:
Arduino Nano notes:
Digital pins 0, 1 used for USB - can't use them at the same time
D13: LED
A6, 7: Can't be used as digital pins

Chips:
LM555:
Pins: Trigger, Threshold, Output, Reset, Discharge, Control voltage
Trigger: On below 1/3 * Vcc - sets SR latch and turns output on
Threshold: Once reach 2/3 * Vcc or more - resets SR latch and turns output off. Additionally connects discharge pin to ground to discharge capacitor
Reset: Disable/resets the timer. Active low. Should be set high.
Discharge: Capacitor discharges through this
Control voltage: Can modify the 2/3 * Vcc threshold value. Usually connected to ground via a bypass cap.

74HC08 - AND gate

74HC138 - 3-8 line decoder
~E1, ~E2, E3: set to enable

74HC154 - 4 to 16 line decoder:
~E1,~E2: enable inputs, tie these both low. I guess they had extra pins?

74HC161 - 4 bit synchronous counter
CEP: count enable - both CEP and CET need to be true to count
CET: input for chaining, TC => CET
TC: output for chaining. True if at highest count and about to roll-over, AND CET is high.
~PE: parallel enable input - for pre-setting values
~MR: resets all to 0, asynchronous

74HC595 - 8 bit shift register
Has a shift register and a storage register. Pulsing SRCLK reads data from SER. Pulsing RCLK outputs data from shift register onto output.
Q(a-h): Output
SER: Input bit for shifting
Qh': Output bit that comes off during a shift
SRCLK: Shift register clock (positive edge)
RCLK: Register clock (positive edge)

Functional units:
Clock:
555 timer for astable multivibrator for clock
555 timer for monostable multivibrator for manual clock
555 timer for bistable multivibrator for switch debouncing

Microop counter 74HC161:
CEP, CET: HIGH so always counts
TC: unconnected
~PE: disabled
~MR: For resetting micro op counter

Control EEPROM #2:
Input: Opcode(8), Microop counter(4)
4 pins: OUT control plane
4 pins: IN control plane
