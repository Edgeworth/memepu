### TODO soon
- Add verilator test for shifter

### TODO later
- Move kicadtools into verymeme - direct generation
  - Can then improve bounding box calculation to look at actual drawn stuff
- Include labels in component bounding box
- Dynamically size generated sheets
- Automation for running verilog tests both with and without SCHEMATIC defined.
- Timing models for each chip
- Read hex-files in at boot time
- Sign extend in ALU somehow.
